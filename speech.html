        How was your day? <br>
       
        What’s the weather like? <br>
        
        What are you going to do? <br>
        
        Take your time, please. <br>
        
        That is what I’m saying. <br>
        
        Is there a hotel in this area? <br>
        
        I don’t know what to say. <br>
   
        I’m about to leave. <br>
     
        Did you clean up in here? <br>
        
        Have you heard of it? <br>
        
        Please take me to the market. <br>
        
        Why are you dressed up? <br>
        
        Would you like to have some coffee? <br>
        
        You seem to be tired.<br>
        
        I’m in good shape. <br>
        
        I think we need to talk about it.<br>
        
        I’d rather not do that. <br>
        
        Hear me out. <br>
        
        I am free today.
